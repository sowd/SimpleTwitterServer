# Simple Twitter Bridge Server by Node.js

Access the server as like:

```bash
$ http://192.168.0.10:1111/f/statuses/user_timeline?screen_name=s_owd
```

The path after ``http://192.168.0.10:1111/f/`` becomes the twitter api path (Eg. ``statuses/user_timeline`` in the following example.)
The POST API requires post access, of course ^^;
